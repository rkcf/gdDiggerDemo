* gdDiggerDemo

An example project using digger algorithms for procedural level generation.


There are two types of diggers implemented here. A RoomDigger and a CorridorDigger. RoomDiggers dig and create rooms, while the CorridorDigger makes pathways and corridors between rooms.


The basic algorithm is as follows:
   1. Pick starting square (somewhere around the middle)
   2. Place a room digger at this location and dig a room out
   3. Generate a random number of corridor diggers in the newly created room. They will dig random corridors out
   4. A new room digger is spawned at the end of the corridor.

This cycle then repeats for a set number of generations to generate the full level

* Ideas
- Add a noise layer that serves as an attractor for turning direction preference. May allow for more natural looking room systems.
- Prune unneeded spindly hallways
- As corridor digger tunnels around, they stop and think to themselves: is this a good place to build a room? If so they destroy themselves and spawn a room builder
